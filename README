### Customs

A proof of concept static code analysis tool capable of identifying module
import side-effects. It uses only standard library Python modules.

Ideally this project will be replaced or subsumed by an upstream static
analysis tool.


#### Test and maintenence

Depends on the interest by other projects such as pylint / ruff / etc.

- seek co-maintainers
- tox / pyproject.toml
- ci integration
- PyPI release?


#### Features

- inline enable / disable
- section block enable / disable
- configurable list of symbols to ignore (currently getLogger is hardcoded)
- Editor integration (VScode / NeoVim / Emacs)

Based on an analysis tool written by Tushar Sadhwani.
